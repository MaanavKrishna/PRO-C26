        2.1 teaspoon sugar
        
        3.1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
        
        4.1/4 cup canola oil

        6.3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
        
        7.1/2 pound Meat/Panner
        
        8.1 small onion, chopped
        
        9.1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce
        
        10.3 teaspoons dried oregano

     <h2>Recipes</h2>
     <p>1.In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.


        2.Turn onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.
        
        
        3.Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.
        
        
        4.Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
